# Market-Profit-Simulation-Premarket-To-Open
A very primitive and crude simulation that analyzes historical stock data to test a simple pre-market momentum strategy. This model assumes that you invest at the specific price, frequency, and date that you input and returns the net profit that you would have made using this strategy. It also compares between two stocks of your choice.   

If you wish to test this out, make sure that Python,PIP, finance, and matplotlib are all installed on your computer. To install yfinance, "pip install yfinance", and matplotlib, "pip install matplotlib" in your terminal. 

When asked about the premarket threshold, be sure to add the float, aka no $ signs.
